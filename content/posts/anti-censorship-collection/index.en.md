Here are a few to collect **Anti-censorship is relevant and neutral** links to technical communication communities, auditing platforms, past research, academic conferences, circumvention tools (homepage), and anti-censorship Internet media for Chinese readers and their introductions hope to provide readers with as many trusted sources of information as possible.

Anyone is welcome to recommend relevant websites/tools in the comment section! When recommending, please include a link to the website and the reason for the recommendation. <br />**NOT accepting anti-censorship internet media with non-neutral political stances or promoting false information.**

Since 2006, The Tor Project, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been operating for free on the global Internet. The Tor Project is committed to promoting human rights and freedoms by giving all Internet users the right to access uncensored websites privately.

(üëÜ The link points to the Rust implementation of the Shadowsocks protocol, both client and server)

Circumvention tools with great influence in the field of Chinese anti-censorship technology, by:[clowwindy](https://github.com/clowwindy/) create. Later, due to force majeure factors, the original author stopped maintenance. It is one of the pioneers of circumvention tools using fully encrypted protocols.

  - Outline  https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/

A fork of V2ray-core, consisting of [RPRX](https://github.com/rprx/) create. On the basis of the original project, XTLS, REALITY, XUDP, fallbacks and other functions have been developed. It has great influence in the field of Chinese anti-censorship technology.

  -Hysteria  https://github.com/apernet/hysteria/

composed [Aperture Internet Laboratory](https://github.com/apernet/) create a circumvention tool, based on a custom QUIC protocol. There are two incompatible versions, v1 and v2. In the field of Chinese anti-censorship technology, it is known for the Brutal congestion control mechanism.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Unfortunately, it will be held on July 15-18, 2024 [The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/‰∏≠ÂõΩÂÖ±‰∫ßÂÖöÁ¨¨‰∫åÂçÅÂ±ä‰∏≠Â§ÆÂßîÂëò‰ºöÁ¨¨‰∏âÊ¨°ÂÖ®‰Ωì‰ºöËÆÆ) during this period, there were spontaneous reports of users blocking UDP-based evasion tools in Chinese mainland ([link](https://linux.do/t/topic/136940/3) from the LinuxDo forum). QUIC is a UDP-based network layer protocol.
    
  - sing-box  https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/

  - GoodbyeDPI  https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/

composed [ValdikSS](https://github.com/ValdikSS) serverless DPI circumvention tool created. It contains a series of evasion methods for anti-DNS poisoning, DNS preemptive answering, plaintext HTTP detection, SNI detection (SNI blacklist) and other censorship strategies. Only runs on Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11.
    
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: GoodbyeDPI is an experimental tool with significant technical limitations that may result in more obvious observability characteristics of evasive traffic. Its concealment and reliability **Doubt** moreover **There is no circumvention of it** iP-based censorship policies.

  - Sheas Cealer  https://github.com/SpaceTimee/Sheas-Cealer/

composed [Space Time](https://github.com/SpaceTimee/) A lightweight serverless DPI circumvention tool created. SNI-based censorship policies can be circumvented by telling the browser to modify the value of the SNI field in the TLS ClientHello destined for the specified domain. The principle is similar [Domain Prepend](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9F%9F%E5%89%8D%E7%BD%AE)„ÄÇ The tool also maintains a comprehensive list of domain names-legal SNI-available IP mappings.
    
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Sheas Cealer is an experimental tool that can break the authentication, stealth, and reliability of TLS **Doubt**.There are significant limitations to the circumvention technique of "domain fronting", and **There is no circumvention of it** iP-based censorship policies.
(As of 2024-08-29, three large CDN providers, including Cloudflare/AWS Cloudfront/Fastly, have disabled "domain fronting.") )
