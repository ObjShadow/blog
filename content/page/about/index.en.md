<font size=5>Use the most common and easy-to-understand language to write the most hardcore anti-censorship technical content. </font>

This is the slogan of this blog, and it is also the goal, purpose, and original intention of the blog. <br>
Writing these technical contents is to hope that readers can understand the spirit of freedom and human ethics behind anti-censorship,<br>
and also be able to gain insight into the technical principles behind anti-censorship, understand cutting-edge anti-censorship research,<br>
and be able to defend their own information freedom, privacy security, and personal dignity in the digital space. <br>

The main direction of this blog is to analyze the circumvention tools that are currently in practical use,<br>
and popularize some basic anti-censorship technical principles to readers in an easy-to-understand way,<br>
and follow up on large-scale anti-censorship conferences of academic nature such as [FOCI](https://foci.community/), [USENIX Security](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24),<br>
try to provide readers with the most understandable, practical, and cutting-edge anti-censorship technical content.

Finally, <br>
I hope that the readers who are reading this article, <br>
will one day break free from this iron cage, <br>
witness that there is no more censorship and totalitarianism in this world, <br>
witness that this blog is no longer necessary, <br>
in the glory of freedom, always remember those <br>
researchers, developers, and propagandists who have contributed to anti-censorship, <br>
and the ordinary people who have tried their best to pursue freedom.
